++++++++++ Step 1: Use firmware (lab4-1) ++++++++++
LA Test 1 started
(Firmware) Detect start mark (8'hA5) on mprj[23:16], start latency timer.
(Firmware) Detect end mark (8'h5A) on mprj[23:16], record latency timer.
(Firmware) Success: Final Y[7:0] output to mprj[31:24] is 0x76, the same as the golden value.
Info: FIR "firmware" latency =     1510415 clock cycles

++++++++++ Step 2: Use hardware (FIR engine)(lab3) ++++++++++
(Round 1) Detect start mark (8'hA5) on mprj[23:16], start latency timer.
(Round 1) Detect end mark (8'h5A) on mprj[23:16], record latency timer.
(Round 1) Success: Final Y[7:0] output to mprj[31:24] is 0x76, the same as the golden value.
Info: FIR engine (hardware) latency in round 1 =      551675 clock cycles
(Round 2) Detect start mark (8'hA5) on mprj[23:16], start latency timer.
(Round 2) Detect end mark (8'h5A) on mprj[23:16], record latency timer.
(Round 2) Success: Final Y[7:0] output to mprj[31:24] is 0x76, the same as the golden value.
Info: FIR engine (hardware) latency in round 2 =      551675 clock cycles
(Round 3) Detect start mark (8'hA5) on mprj[23:16], start latency timer.
(Round 3) Detect end mark (8'h5A) on mprj[23:16], record latency timer.
(Round 3) Success: Final Y[7:0] output to mprj[31:24] is 0x76, the same as the golden value.
Info: FIR engine (hardware) latency in round 3 =      551675 clock cycles
Info: Total FIR engine (hardware) latency =     1655025 clock cycles
LA Test 2 passed
