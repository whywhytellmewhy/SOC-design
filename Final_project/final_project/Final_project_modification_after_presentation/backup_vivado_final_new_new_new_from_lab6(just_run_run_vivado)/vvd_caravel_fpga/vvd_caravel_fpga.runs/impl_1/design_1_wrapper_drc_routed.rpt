REQP-1840#6 Warning
RAMB18 async control check  
The RAMB18E1 design_1_i/caravel_0/inst/soc/core/VexRiscv/RegFilePlugin_regFile_reg_1 has an input control pin design_1_i/caravel_0/inst/soc/core/VexRiscv/RegFilePlugin_regFile_reg_1/ADDRARDADDR[8] (net: design_1_i/caravel_0/inst/soc/core/VexRiscv/decode_RegFilePlugin_regFileReadAddress1[3]) which is driven by a register (design_1_i/caravel_0/inst/housekeeping/wb_ack_o_reg) that has an active asychronous set or reset. This may cause corruption of the memory contents and/or read values when the set/reset is asserted and is not analyzed by the default static timing analysis. It is suggested to eliminate the use of a set/reset to registers driving this RAMB pin or else use a synchronous reset in which the assertion of the reset is timed by default.
